Cross-platform Python logger for [TFA Dostmann Airco2ntrol Mini CO2 monitor](https://www.tfa-dostmann.de/en/product/co2-monitor-airco2ntrol-mini-31-5006/) (31.5006.02) relying on HIDAPI library.

# Prerequisites

This project needs:
 * Python 3
 * [HIDAPI library](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi)
 * [hidapi Python interface](https://pypi.org/project/hidapi/)

## Linux

See what package your distribution provides for the HIDAPI library.

## macOS

The HIDAPI library may be easily installed on macOS with Homebrew:
```shell
brew install hidapi
```

# Getting stared

## Full logging and display

Run the logger script with:
```shell
python3 report.py
```

The script will create a log file `airco2ntrol_<date>T<time>.csv` and open a plotting window. For convenience, we provide the `plot.py` script to plot an existing log file.

## Simple CLI logger

```shell
python3 log.py
```

If you just want to d

# Troubleshooting

## udev rules on Linux
If the script cannot access the device, update your system's udev rules as follow:

 1. Unplug the device
 2. Copy file `90-airco2ntrol_mini.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d`
 3. Reload the rules with `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`
 4. Plug your device.

## matplotlib on macOS

If the plotting window does not show up, you may need to configure the matplotlib backend. Edit file `~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc` and add or edit
```
backend: TkAgg
```

Note that you need the Python Tcl/Tk interface. You can install it with
```shell
brew install python-tk
```
